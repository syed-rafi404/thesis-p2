# Fine-tune evaluation: base vs LoRA

Base model: `openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo`
Adapter: `F:\thesisP2\ft_work_lr\lora_lr2e-3_e4`
Split: `test.jsonl`, clips scored: 102

All text is compared after `normalize_banglish()` from `finetune/prepare_data.py`.

Decoding: greedy.

| Metric | Base | Fine-tuned |
|---|---|---|
| WER, per clip median | 96.7% | 65.9% |
| WER, per clip mean | 116.7% | 85.0% |
| WER, whole split | 93.7% | 59.2% |
| CER, per clip median | 73.2% | 45.9% |
| CER, per clip mean | 90.5% | 62.8% |
| Term recall | 74.3% | 84.0% |
| Term precision | 60.0% | 92.4% |
| Term F1 | 66.4% | 88.0% |
| Clips that run away | 8 of 102 | 6 of 102 |

Means are reported for completeness but are dominated by a few clips where a
model falls into a repetition loop and emits far more words than were spoken,
which pushes error rates above 100%. The rank-based tests below are the ones
to read.

- **WER**: fine-tune wins on 77 of 102 clips. Wilcoxon signed-rank p = 5.63e-07, sign test p = 2.45e-07.
- **CER**: fine-tune wins on 76 of 102 clips. Wilcoxon signed-rank p = 3.12e-07, sign test p = 7.44e-07.

Paired test on the mean per-clip WER, for reference: p = 0.0010 (sign-flip Monte Carlo, n=95, 20000 resamples).

Term F1 here is exact matching against a fixed 82-word English lexicon,
reported only so these numbers sit on the same scale as the 73.9% baseline.
