# Fine-tune evaluation: base vs LoRA

Base model: `openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo`
Adapter: `F:\thesisP2\ft_work_lr\lora_lr2e-3_s1`
Split: `test.jsonl`, clips scored: 102

All text is compared after `normalize_banglish()` from `finetune/prepare_data.py`.

Decoding: greedy.

| Metric | Base | Fine-tuned |
|---|---|---|
| WER, per clip median | 96.7% | 68.3% |
| WER, per clip mean | 116.7% | 87.0% |
| WER, whole split | 93.7% | 59.1% |
| CER, per clip median | 73.2% | 43.8% |
| CER, per clip mean | 90.5% | 61.6% |
| Term recall | 74.3% | 84.0% |
| Term precision | 60.0% | 87.9% |
| Term F1 | 66.4% | 85.9% |
| Clips that run away | 8 of 102 | 5 of 102 |

Means are reported for completeness but are dominated by a few clips where a
model falls into a repetition loop and emits far more words than were spoken,
which pushes error rates above 100%. The rank-based tests below are the ones
to read.

- **WER**: fine-tune wins on 82 of 102 clips. Wilcoxon signed-rank p = 4.56e-10, sign test p = 4.29e-10.
- **CER**: fine-tune wins on 81 of 102 clips. Wilcoxon signed-rank p = 5.06e-10, sign test p = 1.71e-09.

Paired test on the mean per-clip WER, for reference: p = 0.0063 (sign-flip Monte Carlo, n=99, 20000 resamples).

Term F1 here is exact matching against a fixed 82-word English lexicon,
reported only so these numbers sit on the same scale as the 73.9% baseline.
