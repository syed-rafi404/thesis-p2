# Fine-tune evaluation: base vs LoRA

Base model: `openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo`
Adapter: `F:\thesisP2\ft_work_tune5h\lora_lr1e-3`
Split: `test.jsonl`, clips scored: 101

All text is compared after `normalize_banglish()` from `finetune/prepare_data.py`.

Decoding: greedy.

| Metric | Base | Fine-tuned |
|---|---|---|
| WER, per clip median | 97.6% | 61.9% |
| WER, per clip mean | 116.8% | 78.3% |
| WER, whole split | 93.8% | 53.7% |
| CER, per clip median | 73.8% | 42.2% |
| CER, per clip mean | 91.9% | 55.1% |
| Term recall | 74.3% | 83.1% |
| Term precision | 62.2% | 92.0% |
| Term F1 | 67.7% | 87.3% |
| Clips that run away | 8 of 101 | 4 of 101 |

Means are reported for completeness but are dominated by a few clips where a
model falls into a repetition loop and emits far more words than were spoken,
which pushes error rates above 100%. The rank-based tests below are the ones
to read.

- **WER**: fine-tune wins on 81 of 101 clips. Wilcoxon signed-rank p = 8.10e-10, sign test p = 6.93e-10.
- **CER**: fine-tune wins on 86 of 101 clips. Wilcoxon signed-rank p = 3.65e-11, sign test p = 2.83e-13.

Paired test on the mean per-clip WER, for reference: p = 0.0000 (sign-flip Monte Carlo, n=96, 20000 resamples).

Term F1 here is exact matching against a fixed 82-word English lexicon,
reported only so these numbers sit on the same scale as the 73.9% baseline.
