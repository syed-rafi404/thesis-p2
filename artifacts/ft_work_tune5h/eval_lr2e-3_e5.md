# Fine-tune evaluation: base vs LoRA

Base model: `openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo`
Adapter: `F:\thesisP2\ft_work_tune5h\lora_lr2e-3_e5`
Split: `test.jsonl`, clips scored: 101

All text is compared after `normalize_banglish()` from `finetune/prepare_data.py`.

Decoding: greedy.

| Metric | Base | Fine-tuned |
|---|---|---|
| WER, per clip median | 97.6% | 59.6% |
| WER, per clip mean | 116.8% | 72.3% |
| WER, whole split | 93.8% | 51.1% |
| CER, per clip median | 73.8% | 39.4% |
| CER, per clip mean | 91.9% | 51.9% |
| Term recall | 74.3% | 84.3% |
| Term precision | 62.2% | 95.1% |
| Term F1 | 67.7% | 89.4% |
| Clips that run away | 8 of 101 | 3 of 101 |

Means are reported for completeness but are dominated by a few clips where a
model falls into a repetition loop and emits far more words than were spoken,
which pushes error rates above 100%. The rank-based tests below are the ones
to read.

- **WER**: fine-tune wins on 85 of 101 clips. Wilcoxon signed-rank p = 9.86e-14, sign test p = 1.54e-12.
- **CER**: fine-tune wins on 86 of 101 clips. Wilcoxon signed-rank p = 2.25e-13, sign test p = 2.83e-13.

Paired test on the mean per-clip WER, for reference: p = 0.0000 (sign-flip Monte Carlo, n=93, 20000 resamples).

Term F1 here is exact matching against a fixed 82-word English lexicon,
reported only so these numbers sit on the same scale as the 73.9% baseline.
